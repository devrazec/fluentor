# Overview

Fluentor is an intelligent language-learning assistant with voice recognition and text-to-speech (TTS). It analyzes your speaking skills, provides an estimated score, clearly explains each evaluation using rule-based reasoning, and builds a personalized improvement plan tailored to your goals.

How can Fluentor help you?

Beyond scoring, Fluentor gives you practical tools to learn how to speak English naturally and fluently. You follow structured speaking templates that guide each practice session, use shadowing techniques to model native speech, and train your pronunciation, rhythm, and intonation in a natural way. These methods are grounded in cognitive learning principles, helping you internalize patterns and speak more like a native speaker over time.

Fluentor has helped students achieve their goals through personalized feedback, guided speaking practice, and clear learning pathways.

How accurate are Fluentor’s predictions?

Fluentor’s predictions match the same margin of error found between human examiners, delivering highly reliable and consistent results.
